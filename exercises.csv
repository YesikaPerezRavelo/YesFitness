1;Banded crunch isometric hold;"The banded crunch isometric hold is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. The band adds resistance and continuous tension to this popular exercise.";Bands;7
2;FYR Banded Plank Jack;The banded plank jack is a variation on the plank that involves moving the legs in and out for repetitions. Having a band around the thighs forces the lower body to work harder, particularly the hips and glutes. The plank jack is commonly performed as part of a bodyweight circuit, or as part of a dynamic warm-up.;Bands;7
3;Banded crunch;"The banded crunch is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. The band adds resistance and continuous tension to this popular exercise.";Bands;7
4;Crunch;"The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the rectus abdominis, or ""six-pack"" muscles, as well as the obliques. It has been the centerpiece of many ab-focused workouts, due to both its simplicity and the intense burn and mind-muscle connection it produces. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout.";Bands;7
5;Decline band press sit-up;"The decline band press sit-up is a weighted core exercise that works the rectus abdominis or ""six pack"" muscles, as well as the deep core muscles. It also taxes the muscles of the shoulders and upper back.

26;Kettlebell toe-touch;The kettlebell toe-touch is a more difficult version of a highly popular abdominal movement usually done for high reps. The simple addition of a weight makes the toe-touch far more difficult, providing a different stimulus to the core during training.;Kettlebells;9
27;Kettlebell swing;The kettlebell swing is a popular lower-body exercise emphasizing the hamstrings, glutes, and back muscles. It is often used to train explosive power, for aerobic or cardiovascular conditioning, in circuit training, or as an accessory movement for the deadlift.;Kettlebells;9
28;Two-way swing;"The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a ""Russian"" or ""hardstyle"" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an ""American"" swing). Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing.";Kettlebells;9
29;Kettlebell crab reach;The kettlebell crab reach is a kettlebell pressing exercise in which the lifter presses a kettlebell overhead while in a modified single-arm bridge position.

610;Cross-body plank march;The cross-body plank march is an exercise targeting the entire core but especially the obliques. It’s more difficult than a standard plank, with the extra stabilization challenge of bringing one knee at a time off the ground toward the opposing elbow. This will increase the challenge to the core and shoulder muscles, but also present a coordination and balance challenge.;Body Only;8
611;Bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction;The bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction is an advanced exercise that combines the isometric stabilization of the Copenhagen plank with dynamic adductions to challenge the core stabilizers and adductors. This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or Copenhagen plank first.;Body Only;9

This combination can be performed for time or for reps, often as circuit-style training for conditioning or fat loss, or in a kettlebell complex or flow.;Kettlebells;8
1885;FYR Goblet Squat;The goblet squat is a popular lower-body exercise where you hold a kettlebell or dumbbell in front of your chest as if you are supporting a heavy cup or goblet. It can help lifters of all levels improve their squat technique and hip mobility, but can also work as a muscle-building or strength accessory movement for experienced athletes. It also works well in combinations, complexes, and flows with other kettlebell movements like swings, presses, and cleans.;Kettlebells;8
1886;FYR Kettlebell Sumo Squat;The kettlebell sumo squat is a lower-body movement emphasizing the muscles of the hips, glutes, and quads. It shares attributes with both the kettlebell deadlift and the goblet squat, but is usually performed with a wider stance and the feet pointed more outward, similar to a sumo deadlift. Its unique stance helps the lifter keep an upright torso, as well as emphasize stretching the hips and adductor muscles.;Kettlebells;8
1887;Double-kettlebell front squat;The double-kettlebell front squat is a popular kettlebell movement performed while holding two kettlebells in the front-racked position.

1915;Dumbbell Goblet Squat;The goblet squat is a common exercise used in the early stages of learning to squat, or as a movement in general training programs for building size to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings.;Dumbbell;8
1916;Dumbbell squat;The dumbbell squat is a classic lower-body exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. While this variation is usually performed with relatively light weights for high reps, it can also be used as a substitute for squats or the trap-bar deadlift in any workout.;Dumbbell;8
1917;Dumbbell Lunges;The dumbbell split squat is a popular lower-body exercise to build strength and muscle one leg at a time. It can be used to teach proper lunge form, but is also valuable on its own when trained in traditional strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.;Dumbbell;8
1918;Dumbbell reverse lunge;The dumbbell reverse lunge is a popular lower-body movement that targets the muscles of the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and hips. It also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Lunge variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per leg or more, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing split squats instead.;Dumbbell;8
1919;Split Squat with Dumbbells;The dumbbell Bulgaria split squat is a single-leg exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings.;Dumbbell;8
1920;Dumbbell sumo squat;The dumbbell sumo squat is a popular lower-body movement using a single dumbbell held in front of the legs. It is performed with a wider than shoulder-width stance, which increases the demand on the glutes, hamstrings, and adductors while still benefiting the quads, core, and upper body. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout.;Dumbbell;8
1921;Dumbbell seated box jump;The dumbbell seated box jump is an explosive exercise that builds the quadriceps as well as overall lower-body strength and explosiveness. All you need is a box, a bench, and a light dumbbell. Performing it from a seated position eliminates the stretch reflex in the lower body, forcing you to generate more power. This is an advanced move, so consider starting off with box jumps or squat jumps before progressing to this.;Dumbbell;8
1922;Dumbbell step-up;The dumbbell step-up is a great exercise for building lower-body strength and power. It targets all the same muscles as bodyweight step-ups, such as the quads, glutes, and hamstrings, but allows for greater muscular overload.;Dumbbell;8

1926;Dumbbell front squat;The dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.;Dumbbell;7
1927;Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Squat;none;Dumbbell;7
1928;Dumbbell lateral hop;The dumbbell lateral hop is an explosive exercise that targets the muscles of the hips and legs. Adding dumbbells adds a challenge to the core, as well. Because balance can be a challenge, it is usually performed with relatively light weights, often as a component of fat-loss or athletic training.;Dumbbell;7
1929;Dumbbell lunge with biceps curl;The dumbbell lunge with biceps curl combines an isometric hold at the bottom of a lunge with a dumbbell biceps curl. The two exercises combine to target the legs, core, and biceps. The curl will determine the amount of weight you can use, but even a light weight will make the lunge hold seriously challenging.;Dumbbell;7

1937;Single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift;The single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift is a movement targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.;Dumbbell;7

2440;Band shoulder press;The band shoulder press is a deltoid exercise and an alternative to the classic dumbbell shoulder press. The dynamic tension of the band forces the core to stabilize the body and more closely matches the strength curve of the shoulder press. It can be performed in low reps, such as 5-8 reps per set, to build shoulder strength, or for higher reps to build muscle and for conditioning. It can work as the main focus of a shoulder day but is also popular as an accessory movement to the bench press or barbell military press.;Bands;9
2441;Band lateral raise;The band lateral raise is a shoulder exercise that targets the medial or middle head of the deltoid muscle. It's a variation of the dumbbell lateral raise, a staple strength-training move. The band lateral raise is a great option for warm-up or accessory work on upper-body training days. The dynamic tension of the band provides constant tension and matches the strength curve of the movement.

2451;Seated barbell shoulder press;The seated barbell shoulder press is a classic exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also play a significant role in pressing the barbell overhead. Performing the movement seated reduces help from the lower body and decreases the risk of overextending the lumbar spine during the movement. This press variation can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout.;Barbell;8
2452;Snatch-Grip Behind-The-Neck Overhead Press;none;Barbell;9
2453;Standing Bradford press;The standing Bradford press is an obscure yet effective shoulder exercise that alternates front presses with behind-the-neck presses.

2459;Machine Shoulder (Military) Press;The machine shoulder press is an upper body exercise targeting the deltoids.;Barbell;8
2460;Standing Barbell Press Behind Neck;The standing behind-the-head press is a classic shoulder exercise that was used widely during bodybuilding's professed Golden Era. In addition to the deltoids, it also works the trapezius and triceps muscles. It may not be a good choice for some people's shoulders, depending on their injury history. It can be trained in strength-focused rep ranges, but is more commonly trained in moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps per set.;Barbell;9
2461;Barbell front raise;The barbell front raise is an upper-body isolation exercise that targets the shoulders. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or higher, as part of the shoulder-focused part of any workout.;Barbell;8
2462;Overhead bar front raise;The overhead bar front raise is an exercise targeting the muscles of the traps (trapezius), especially the upper traps, as well as the front or anterior shoulders. It can also be performed with a weight plate or dumbbell, providing a neutral grip that may be more shoulder-friendly for some lifters. Overhead raises are most common for high reps (at least 8-12 reps per set or higher) on a shoulder, trap, or other upper-body-focused muscle-building day.;Barbell;9
2463;Incline barbell shoulder protraction;The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.;Barbell;8
2464;Behind-the-head push-press;The behind-the-head push-press is an overhead press variation in which the barbell starts in the back rack position and is pushed overhead with assistance from the lower body. It is most often seen in training for Olympic weightlifting. It can be part of a barbell complex or performed for low reps focusing on power and movement quality.;Barbell;9

It was once contested as a fourth powerlift, but is rarely competed anymore. However, being able to press a significant weight overhead remains a popular marker of upper-body strength. The military press can be trained as a strength lift or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges as part of full-body, shoulder-focused, or upper-body training.;Barbell;9
2473;Incline Front Barbell Raise - Gethin Variation;The incline face-down bar front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle. Raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder-focused training.;Barbell;8

2525;Dumbbell front raise to lateral raise;The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise is a dumbbell complex that combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you perform it, it targets both the anterior and medial deltoids, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day.;Dumbbell;7
2526;Single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press;The single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press builds the shoulder muscles but with two major differences from the standard dumbbell shoulder press. It's done one arm at a time and the wrist stays neutral throughout the movement. It can be performed standing or seated. A single dumbbell press can be pursued as a strength goal, or trained in traditional muscle-building rep ranges such as 8-15 reps per set or more.;Dumbbell;8
2527;Standing palms-in shoulder press;The standing palms-in shoulder press is a dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.;Dumbbell;7
2528;Seated Dumbbell Press;The seated dumbbell shoulder pressis an exercise for building muscle and strengthening the shoulders, particularly but not exclusively the front heads. The triceps also assist. Some lifters feel that using dumbbells versus a barbell reduced injury risk.;Dumbbell;8
2529;Standing dumbbell shoulder press;The standing dumbbell shoulder press is a classic deltoid-building exercise that is common in gyms around the world. Performing the move standing up as opposed to seated allows more weight to be used and taxes the core more than seated presses. The standing press is worthy of being the main movement in a muscle-building shoulder workout, but is also a great strength movement and accessory for the bench press.;Dumbbell;7
2530;Single-arm lateral raise;The single-arm lateral raise is a shoulder exercise that targets the medial or middle head of the deltoid muscle. It's a staple strength-training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper-body training days. Hold on to a post for balance, or do it free-standing to challenge core strength and stability. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.;Dumbbell;8
2531;Power Partials;none;Dumbbell;7
2532;Incline dumbbell reverse fly;The incline dumbbell reverse fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior or rear deltoids, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.;Dumbbell;8
2533;Overhead dumbbell front raise;The overhead dumbbell front raise takes the dumbbell front raise one step further, extending the motion all the way above the head. In addition to the shoulders, it activates and strengthens the muscles of the traps and upper back. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps or more. It can be part of a dynamic upper-body warm-up, performed as a muscle-building upper-body movement, or as a burnout movement on shoulder day.;Dumbbell;7
2534;Seated dumbbell shoulder press;The seated dumbbell shoulder press is a popular exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also work hard in this lift. Many lifters find using dumbbells to be more comfortable and shoulder-friendly for this press variation than a barbell. This can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout.;Dumbbell;8
2535;Alternating standing shoulder press;The alternating standing shoulder press is a popular dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.;Dumbbell;7
2536;Single-arm incline rear delt raise;The single-arm incline rear delt raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior deltoids or shoulder muscles, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Training each side independently can help correct imbalances in size, strength, and shoulder stability. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.;Dumbbell;8
2537;Alternating dumbbell front raise;The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. Performing the movement one shoulder at a time gives a momentary rest to each side while the other is working, potentially allowing you to do more reps during each set. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.;Dumbbell;7
2538;Alternating Deltoid Raise;The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders.;Dumbbell;8
2539;Single-dumbbell front raise;The single-dumbbell front raise is an isolation movement that targets the shoulders. In particular, it focuses on the anterior or front head of the deltoid muscles. By performing it with one dumbbell at a time, you can focus on each shoulder muscle independently and try to address muscular imbalances between shoulders. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.;Dumbbell;7
2540;Arnold press;Named after the iconic bodybuilder and movie star, the Arnold press adds rotation to a classic shoulder press. It allows the hands to rotate naturally, while also hitting all three heads of the deltoids in one motion. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.;Dumbbell;8
2541;Single-arm standing shoulder press;The single-arm standing shoulder press is a popular exercise to build size and strength the shoulders and triceps. Most lifters find they can go heavier (per arm) on this movement than if they are pressing two dumbbells simultaneously, making it an effective strength movement as well as a muscle-building movement in higher reps.;Dumbbell;7
2542;Dumbbell front raise;The dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.;Dumbbell;8
2543;Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row;The bent-over dumbbell rear delt row is a popular upper-body exercise that targets the muscles on the backside of the shoulder joint, specifically the medial and rear heads of the deltoid. Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout.;Dumbbell;7
2544;Incline dumbbell front raise;The incline dumbbell front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle. Raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder-focused training.;Dumbbell;8
2545;Side Lateral Raise;The dumbbell lateral raise is an upper body isolation exercise for building shoulder strength and muscle. It's a staple strength training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper body training days. This exercise particularly focuses on the lateral or medial head of the deltoid, making them appear wider and more developed.;Dumbbell;7
2546;Dumbbell external shoulder rotation;The dumbbell external shoulder rotation is a lightweight dumbbell exercise intended to maintain the health of the shoulder joints, including the rotator cuffs. It is often used as a warm-up or prehab for a shoulder or chest-focused workout with lots of pressing.;Dumbbell;8
2547;Single-arm incline lateral raise;The single-arm incline lateral raise is an exercise targeting the lateral or medial head of the shoulder muscles. It is performed lying sideways on an incline bench set to around 45 degrees, which helps to increase the range of motion in the lift and enforce strict form. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.;Dumbbell;7
2548;Seated rear delt fly;The seated rear delt fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the real deltoid of the shoulder. By performing the movement seated, it eliminates momentum from the rest of the body. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.;Dumbbell;8
2549;Dumbbell Raise;none;Dumbbell;7

2551;Dumbbell Lying Rear Lateral Raise;The incline dumbbell reverse fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior or rear deltoids, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.;Dumbbell;7
2552;Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise;The head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise is an exercise targeting the posterior shoulder muscles, or rear deltoids. This variation of the bent-over rear delt raise often helps to better isolate this area of the shoulder. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.;Dumbbell;8
2553;Cuban press;The Cuban press is an exercise that targets the muscles of the shoulders, rotator cuff, and upper back. It combines a shoulder external rotation with a dumbbell press, training multiple muscles and motions in a single sequence. It can be performed standing, or as a more difficult variation face-down on an incline bench. It is usually performed with relatively light weight as part of a dynamic warm-up for upper-body lifting.;Dumbbell;7

2560;Single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press;The single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press is a popular exercise to target the deltoid muscles while also developing strength and stability in the core and hips. Balance can be a challenge, which is one reason why this movement is generally trained lighter than standing single-arm shoulder presses. The half-kneeling press can be used as an accessory lift for the shoulder press or bench press, or simply as a technique to make shoulder presses stricter and more athletic.;Dumbbell;8
2561;Dumbbell Clean And Jerk;none;Dumbbell;7
2562;Dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation;The dumbbell shoulder press with body rotation is a twist on the traditional dumbbell shoulder press. Rather than pressing straight overhead, you twist your torso and hips to the side during each rep. It hits the deltoid muscles just like a shoulder press, but adds a challenge to the core, hips, and back muscles. Due to the potential balance challenge of twisting and pressing at the same time, it is commonly performed with light to moderate weights.;Dumbbell;8

Performing the movement from the hang position, rather than from the ground, emphasizes explosive hip and upper-body power. It can be performed for low reps with a focus on power and speed, or for higher reps to build muscle or as part of a metabolic conditioning circuit.;Dumbbell;7
2576;Surfer sprawl;"The surfer sprawl is an explosive bodyweight exercise that targets multiple muscle groups across the upper and lower body. It is similar to a burpee, but instead of jumping at the top, you end in a ""surfer position,"" alternating sides with each rep. It can be performed for time or reps in any fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout. The surfer position offers a unique way to challenge the body by staying in a low position rather than standing up after the plank.";Dumbbell;7
2577;Dumbbell clean and press;The dumbbell clean and press is a full-body movement that targets both the lower and upper body. The clean utilizes the muscles of the hips, legs, glutes, back, and biceps, while the press utilizes the shoulders and triceps.
